## Ashutosh Pathak

I work on large-scale machine learning systems, focusing on the design, training, and deployment of models that operate reliably under real-world conditions. My interests include large language models, multimodal architectures, retrieval-augmented generation, and the data/compute infrastructure required to support them.

My work spans the entire lifecycle of modern ML systems: dataset construction, training pipelines, evaluation methodology, and inference optimization. I care about clarity in system design, reproducibility, and empirical rigor. I also build tools that make model behavior more interpretable and controllable.

I hold a Bachelor's and Master’s in Computer Science (Machine Learning). I write about ML, systems, and experimentation at https://thenumbercrunch.com/. 

Side projects include HiveHaven - a lightweight platform for international students seeking housing in the U.S., and PolNet - a data visualization tool for analyzing and visualizing U.S. congressional caucus memberships and political network data.
