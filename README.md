## 👋 Hi, I'm Ashutosh Pathak!
- 👀 I’m an aspiring *Machine Learning Engineer* who is also a *noob guitarist* and a *geopolitical enthusiast*. *I love Anime* and my favorites include My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, and Attack on Titan.
- 🌱 Currently, I am building *HiveHaven* - an accommodation solution for international students in the US. Other than this, I am also actively researching on *LLM uncertainity* and how it can impact real human lives when applied in healthcare.
- 🌏 I am always on the *lookout for interesting geopolitical conversations*, so don't be shy and hit me up if you also share this interest of mine!
- 💞️ I’m also *looking to collaborate* on projects that expand my skillsets. This could be literally anything in software and hardware/robotics that catches my interest.
- 👨🏽‍🎓 I recently graduated with a Masters in Computer Science concentrating in Machine Learning with a 3.7 GPA. I am specialized in using classical machine learning approaches as well as Computer Vision and NLP (including LLMs).
- 👨🏽‍💻 That said, **I am looking for jobs in Data and AI domains**. Hit me up if you find my profile interesting! You'll find my socials at the bottom of this document.
